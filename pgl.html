Fee structure is feasible but college a lot fine criteria. Because during my time i had to pay 64k per year fee to my college. But due to many mistakes like bunking classes, plucking flower, forgetting identity card, they put lot of fines. I think they are earning more in fine than in fees

COURSE CURRICULUM -
As my institute is affliated to RGPV that is state technical university. So its course was not that lengthey type. It was good nd course always got completed on time And college has a startup driven program "ideapad" which helps the students who has innovative idea to work upon itFEES -
